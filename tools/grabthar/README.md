# Grabthar
## "By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings!"

This tool takes a centralized config, `./grabthar.yaml`, and does two things
with it:

1. Exposes objects useful for configuring eslint and vite
2. Generates configuration files for prettier and tsc

Currently, no attempt has been made to have Grabthar generalizable to
projects other than Matanuska. But it's named after an attempt at a build tool
I made when I was young, and I always thought the joke was funny, so it's an
open possibility.
