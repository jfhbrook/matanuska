# @matanuska/readline

`@matanuska/readline` contains Matanuska's REPL (readline) implementation. It wraps `node:readline/promises` and other Node core capabilities,handles Matanuska-specific logic, and attempts to expose a simplified, tailored interface.

The interface is a work in progress, and is expected to change significantly over time.

This module is expected to be implemented in pure C++ in the QT implementation.
