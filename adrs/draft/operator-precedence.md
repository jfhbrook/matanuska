# ADR ??? - Operator Precedence

### Status: Draft

### Josh Holbrook

## Context

This behavior is defined in the parser, and tested in `precedence.ts`. The test is also procedurally generated with `test-generator`. But we should make all of this explicit.

I believe my reference has been Visual Basic:
