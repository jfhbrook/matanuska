### Status: Draft
### Josh Holbrook

## Context

`Writing Interactive Compilers & Interpreters` discusses the need for a
"symbol dump", which logs the contents of all global variables.

There are other language facilities which are similar:

- `env` in Bash
- "heap dumps" in Node.js and other languages
