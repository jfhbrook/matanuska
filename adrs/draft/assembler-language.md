# ADR ??? - Assembler Language
### Status: Draft
### Josh Holbrook

## Context

Matanuska BASIC will be using a bytecode runtime. At a minimum this will
require disassembly for debugging purposes. But it also suggests that it would
be useful to develop a bytecode assembler as well.

Architecturally, these would mirror the BASIC scanner, parser and recreator.
