# ADR ??? - Dates, DateTimes & Durations

### Status: Draft

### Josh Holbrook

## Context

Matanuska BASIC needs a consistent way of managing dates, datetimes, time zones and durations.

### BASIC8

[BASIC8](https://paladin-t.github.io/b8/docs/manual) follows an interesting pattern for "advanced" data types. Rather than having a literal syntax, BASIC8 tends to use functions to generate and manipulate these types.

## Decision
