# ADR ??? - Performance Tests
### Status: Draft
### Josh Holbrook

## Context

Both `Writing Interactive Compilers & Interpreters` (WIC&I) and
`Crafting Interpreters` stress the importance of performance tests.

WIC&I includes the advice of comparing  your performance to similar languages.
For me, that probably means `bash` and other shells.

CI says to compare performance before and after a code change, to see if your
optimizations are actually helping.
