# Matanuska BASIC

Matanuska is a BASIC dialect designed for use as a shell.  It asks what it
would've been like if the classic 80s BASIC was better able to rise to the
occasion when it came to disk features and/or competing with DOS.

Matanuska is still in development, and needs a lot of work before it's ready
for regular use. 

## Install

There currently aren't any installable packages for Matanuska. If you would
like to try it today, follow the instructions for development.

## Development

Matanuska BASIC uses `npm` for all of its tasks. Refer to `package.json`
for details.

## ADRs

Architectural decisions are documented in [./adrs](./adrs). Notes on future
decisions I haven't made yet are in [./adrs/draft](./adrs/draft).
