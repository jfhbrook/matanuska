# Matanuska BASIC

Matanuska is a BASIC dialect designed for use as a shell.  It asks what it
would've been like if the classic 80s BASIC was better able to rise to the
occasion when it came to disk features and/or competing with DOS.

Matanuska is still in development, and needs a lot of work before it's ready
for regular use. 

## Install

There currently aren't any installable packages for Matanuska. If you would
like to try it today, follow the instructions for development.

## Development

Matanuska BASIC uses `npm` for all of its tasks. Refer to `package.json`
for details.

## ADRs

Architectural decisions are documented in [./adrs](./adrs). Notes on future
decisions I haven't made yet are in [./adrs/draft](./adrs/draft).

## Current Status and Next Steps

The interpreter can run "hello world" in a REPL and evaluate simple
expressions. Now is time to add some basic features and button up a few
gaps.

### Prioritized Backlog

- if/else
  - [ ] ADR for if/else syntax
  - [X] ShortIf and If in AST
  - [X] Update the AST and ADR to not use nesting
  - [ ] ShortIf in parser
  - [ ] If in parser
  - [ ] Instructions needed to implement ShortIf/If
  - [ ] ShortIf in compiler
  - [ ] If in compiler
  - [ ] What if long if typed into repl?
- fix renum
  - match number (include leading whitespace)
  - get number length
  - traverse and re-number elements/tokens based on changed length
  - test where `100` gets renumbered to `10`
  - test where `10` gets renumbered to `100`
- consider using runtimeMethod decorator elsewhere
- rename "arguments" to "params"?
- for/while/goto
  - [ ] ADR for for/while/goto
- Logical operators
  - [X] Support through the parser
- Complete Print syntax
  - Print can take multiple arguments
  - Print can also take a channel config
- Switch typescript to `module: "nodenext"`
  - use require() for node modules
  - use mjs for own modules
  - upgrade strip-ansi
  - switch to 'node:{}' style requires
- Expanded list
  - `list 10`
  - `list 10-20`
- Functions
  - [ ] ADR for functions (and maybe subroutines?)
  - Local variables
  - Closures
  - Native functions
- Path navigation - cd, ls, etc
  - `cd` is a builtin ("native function")
  - `ls` and others are on the PATH, actually
- Date/Time/Duration/TZData types
  - Core library
  - Host support
  - (Language support can come later)
- REPL history support
  - Support \# and \! in prompt rendering
- Shell commands
  - Will need to research jobs in Bash
  - Scanner and parser support for shell commands and "shell tokens"
  - Compiler support for shell commands
  - Host support for shell commands
  - Runtime support for shell commands
  - Support \j in prompt rendering
  - (Pipes will come later)
- Shell variable export
- PS1/PS2 support
  - `SET PS1` and `SET PS2`?
- Type-checking compiler
  - Implement type analogues to operations
  - Simulated stack in the compiler

### Up Next

- Investigate [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging)
- Escaped newlines
- Arrays
  - Including array literals - BASIC assigns each index one at a time, or
    uses the `data` command
- Implement Acey Ducey
  - `center$(n)`
  - `rnd!` (random) function
  - If/then/goto
  - functions
  - no-arguments print
  - `end` command
- Hashes
- Date/time language support
- Exception language support
- Test harness
  - `test` and `assert` commands
  - Runtime "test mode" and entrypoint subcommand
  - Reporter, possibly based off node-tap
- File I/O
- Research garbage collection
  - TypeScript is obviously garbage collected
  - But the architecture may hang onto references I don't want
- Tab-complete support in the REPL
- Starship support
- Stream/pipe support
- Break-in
  - MSX BASIC uses the `stop` and `cont` commands to control break-in behavior
  - Will need to intercept and handle ctrl-c from readline (ctrl-stop in
    MSX BASIC)
- Symbol dump
- Profiling
  - Line-based for users
  - Opcode-based for me
- Performance tests
  - Benchmarks
  - Profile slow benchmarks
- Editor plugins
- Generated "exceedingly large" script tests

### The Future

- String templates
- Module system
- Package manager
- Partial rewrite in Rust and/or C/C++
- Implement entry point in Rust or C/C++
- Rollup "release build"?
- Port to bun?
  - Nice FFI
  - Support for bundled executable
- Object support
- Vector/matrix support for 1D/2D integer/float arrays
- Assembler mini-language
- Stack trace tests robust against different node versions
