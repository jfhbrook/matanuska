# Matanuska BASIC

Matanuska is a BASIC dialect designed for use as a shell.  It asks what it
would've been like if the classic 80s BASIC was better able to rise to the
occasion when it came to disk features and/or competing with DOS.

Matanuska is still in development, and needs a lot of work before it's ready
for regular use. 

## Install

There currently aren't any installable packages for Matanuska. If you would
like to try it today, follow the instructions for development.

## Development

Matanuska BASIC uses `npm` for all of its tasks. Refer to `package.json`
for details.

## ADRs

Architectural decisions are documented in [./adrs](./adrs). Notes on future
decisions I haven't made yet are in [./adrs/draft](./adrs/draft).

## Current Status and Next Steps

The interpreter can run "hello world" in a REPL and evaluate simple
expressions. Now is time to add some basic features and button up a few
gaps.

### Prioritized Backlog

- "Expect" tests for the REPL and script input
  - Including generated "exceedingly large" tests
- flags
  - `--run` flag for `load`
- attach cmdNo to AST somehow
- Global variables
- If/else
- For and while
- Logical operators
  - [X] Support through the parser
  - [ ] Requires Jump and JumpIfFalse operators
- Complete Print syntax
  - Print can take multiple arguments
  - Print can also take a channel config
- Support `end`
  - In MSX BASIC, `end` closes open files and ends program execution. It's
    distinct from a bare `exit`, insofar as `end` will hand control back to the
    commander in the context of a `run`.
  - In MSX BASIC, `stop` 
- REPL history support
  - Support \# and \! in prompt rendering
- Gotos
- Shell commands
  - Will need to research jobs in Bash
  - Scanner and parser support for shell commands and "shell tokens"
  - Compiler support for shell commands
  - Host support for shell commands
  - Runtime support for shell commands
  - Support \j in prompt rendering
  - (Pipes will come later)
- Shell variable export
- Date/Time/Duration/TZData types
  - Core library
  - Host support
  - (Language support can come later)
- PS1/PS2 support
  - `SET PS1` and `SET PS2`?
- Move FS calls into the Host
  - This has challenges matching the types of Node.JS's fs module
- Type-checking compiler
  - Implement type analogues to operations
  - Simulated stack in the compiler
- Escaped newlines

### Up Next

- Arrays
  - Including array literals - BASIC assigns each index one at a time, or
    uses the `data` command
- Functions and/or subroutines
  - Local variables
  - Closures
  - Native functions
- Implement Acey Ducey
  - `center$(n)`
  - `rnd!` (random) function
  - If/then/goto
  - functions
  - no-arguments print
  - `end` command
- Hashes
- Date/time language support
- Exception language support
- Test harness
  - `test` and `assert` commands
  - Runtime "test mode" and entrypoint subcommand
  - Reporter, possibly based off node-tap
- File I/O
- Research garbage collection
  - TypeScript is obviously garbage collected
  - But the architecture may hang onto references I don't want
- Tab-complete support in the REPL
- Starship support
- Stream/pipe support
- Break-in
  - MSX BASIC uses the `stop` and `cont` commands to control break-in behavior
  - Will need to intercept and handle ctrl-c from readline (ctrl-stop in
    MSX BASIC)
- Symbol dump
- Profiling
  - Line-based for users
  - Opcode-based for me
- Performance tests
  - Benchmarks
  - Profile slow benchmarks
- Editor plugins

### The Future

- String templates
- Module system
- Package manager
- Partial rewrite in Rust and/or C/C++
- Implement entry point in Rust or C/C++
- Rollup "release build"?
- Port to bun?
  - Nice FFI
  - Support for bundled executable
- Object support
- Vector/matrix support for 1D/2D integer/float arrays
- Assembler mini-language
