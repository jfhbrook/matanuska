/**
 * Render a prompt string's special characters. This is an implementation,
 * more or less, of how Bash renders $PS1 (and $PS2, $PS3 and $PS4).
 *
 * Like in Bash, special characters are preceded with a backslash. Most of
 * Bash's special characters are supported, with some caveats:
 *
 *     \d: The date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26").
 *     \D: The format is passed to strftime (a node module compatible with
 *       strftime(3). If no format is specified, the default is %H:%M:%S.
 *     \h: The hostname up to the first period.
 *     \H: The entire hostname.
 *     \j: Once I actually support shell jobs, this will be the number of jobs.
 *     \l: The basename of the user's TTY.
 *     \s: The basename of the current shell (ie, this program).
 *     \t: The time in 24 hour HH:MM:SS format.
 *     \T: The time in 12 hour HH:MM:SS format.
 *     \@: The time in 12 hour am/pm format.
 *     \A: The time in 24 hour HH:MM format.
 *     \u: The username of the current user.
 *     \v: The Matanuska BASIC version without the patch.
 *     \V: The full Matanuska BASIC version *with* the patch.
 *     \w: The current working directory, where $HOME is abbreviated with a tilde.
 *     \!: When I have history and feel like keeping count, the history number
 *       of the command.
 *     \#: When I can run commands and feel like keeping count, the command
 *       number. This is different from history in that history carries
 *       across sessions.
 *     \$: If the uid is 0 (ie, you're root), a #. Otherwise a $.
 *     \nnn: When a backslash is followed by some amount of octal digits, use
 *       those digits to represent a unicode character by code. In Bash, this is
 *       necessarily 3 digits long and is an ASCII lookup. However, JavaScript
 *       uses UTF-16 and so can handle pretty big numbers. This implementation
 *       is limited to 6, which is how many characters 65535 is in octal.
 *     \\: Just a cheeky little backslash.
 *     \[: Blank, for compatibility with Bash. See the note on non-printing
 *       characters.
 *     \]: Blank, for compatibility with Bash. See the note on non-printing
 *       characters.
 *
 * In cases where there's a backslash but no escape code, the backslash is
 * dropped and the rest of the characters are left alone.
 *
 * A few escape characters are not handled by this function, because they
 * should be handled in standard string parsing:
 *
 *     \a: A bell character.
 *     \e: An escape character, ie. \u001b.
 *
 * Note the \t escape sequence has a different definition from standard
 * strings, where it translate to a tab character. This means that the parser
 * must treat prompt strings as a special case.
 *
 * NOTE On OS-Related Functionality:
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * OS-related functionality (such as the hostname or username) are provided
 * by the Host object, and may vary significantly between implementations.
 * While the Host object may return 'null' for certain operations, this
 * renderer tries to gracefully degrade to sensible defaults that might be
 * lying but at least look cool. For more details, peruse 'host.ts'.
 *
 * NOTE on Non-Printing Characters:
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * Bash's equivalent to this procedure counts the length of the prompt,
 * in character widths, while scanning it. In order to get the layout right, it
 * needs to avoid counting non-printing characters. However, it doesn't have
 * an exhaustive sense of which characters are non-printing - apparently.
 *
 * The way Bash solves this is by using \[ to signal to the procedure to
 * stop counting characters, and by using \] to tell it to start up again.
 *
 * In my case, I'm using node's readline module, and it seems to solve the
 * problem by knowing a set of characters that are zero width - presumably
 * ANSI escape characters and a few common unicode zero-width glyphs. I
 * honestly don't know if this approach is better or worse than Bash's. All I
 * know is that I don't need to tell the readline module how long the prompt
 * is.
 *
 * From a rendering perspective, the output looks the same. However, as far
 * as giving rendering hints to the interpreter goes, it does nothing.
 *
 * @param promptString The prompt string to render.
 * @param host a Host.
