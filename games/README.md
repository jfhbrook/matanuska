It contains 101 BASIC games from the early microcomputing era. They're intended
to have a wide compatibility with common BASIC dialects - originally targeting
the DEC Timeshared 8, RSTS-11, HP 2000 and CDC 3600; and later the Altair 8800
and Microsoft Basic. The versions in the book are thoroughly tested with
Microsoft Basic 4.0 with an 80 column terminal, with ports to Apple II BASIC,
DEC Basic Plus, Commodore BASIC and others being straightforward.

These games operate both as a showcase of what Matanuska BASIC is capable of and
as a way to show where Matanuska BASIC is or is not compatibile with Microsoft
BASIC 4.0.
